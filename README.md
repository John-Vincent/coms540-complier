# Latex source #
I got points off for not having my latex source last time.
It does exist its in src/docs/developers.tex

## making files 

* to make all the pdf documents run `make docs`
* to make all the source code run `make compiler`
* to make both (defaul) just run `make`
* to clean the directory run `make clean`

pdflatex is the program used to compile the latex files
and gcc is used to to compile the c code, you can change this 
with the variables in the top of the make file
