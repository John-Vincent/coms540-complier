## making files 

* to make all the pdf documents run `make docs`
* to make all the source code run `make compiler`
* to make both (defaul) just run `make`

pdflatex is the program used to compile the latex files
and gcc is used to to compile the c code, you can change this 
with the variables in the top of the make file
